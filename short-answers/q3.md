# Question
Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer


Use \b when you want to match the position between a word character (like letters, digits, or underscores) and a non-word character (anything that is not a word character), or between the beginning/end of a string and a word character.


# Teacher Feedback
3/3. `\b` also ensures you get only what were looking for without extra spaces.
