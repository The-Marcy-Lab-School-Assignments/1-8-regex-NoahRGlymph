# Question
What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer

Email Validation: You need to ensure that the email addresses provided by users follow the standard format. This includes checking for the presence of an "@" symbol, a domain name, and a valid top-level domain (TLD). Writing custom code to validate email addresses can be complex and error-prone. However, with RegEx, you can use a pattern like ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$ to accurately validate email addresses.
